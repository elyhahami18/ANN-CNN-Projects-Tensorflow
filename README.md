# Fashion_-MNIST
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
In this jupyter notebook file, I read the Fashion-MNIST data from keras.datasets, standardize the data, and train a NN model. A very basic/simple example, was just playing around with image classification during a 45 min plane ride.
